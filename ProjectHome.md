MSRI Alumni – Abstract
An alumni website is used to find the jobs through the alumni. Alumni website is very useful for passed out students as well as pursuing students. These people will get the real time experience and guidelines from the old students.
> In this alumni website we provide the facility of online registration for old students. They will come to know the day to day programs of college. They can share their thoughts to make the event a success. If any new events are going on in the college, they will know through their email. It is beneficial to bring the alumni as the guest lecture so that they can help the students to start their career. In this website we have the information of alumni like their names, contact number, present working organization and the platform they are working on etc.
> This website is useful to increase the interaction between the passed out students and pursuing students through a search option. We can search the candidates by organization, by passed out year and we can also search by which platform they are working on.
> The process of registration of alumni starts with validation of passed out student. They have to enter their name as per the college records. If they enter the details correctly, they will get the registration form otherwise they will get an error message. After successful validation they have to fill the registration form and submit it.
