<h2>ABOUT MIPGS</h2>
</p>

<p>
	<span class="boldtext">MIPGS i.e., Matrusri Institute of
		Post-Graduate Studies,</span> was earlier part of its sister concern MVSR
	Engineering college. MVSR EC was founded by Matrusri Education Society
	(MES) in 1981 with three disciplines in engineering. Over the year it
	has grown from strength to strength and now is a premier technical
	institute in Andhra Pradesh.
</p>

<p>In the due course the Management recognized the growing need of
	management education with emerging trends in the field of information
	technology. As a result two P.G. courses viz. MCA and MBA were
	introduced in MVSR Engineering College during the years 1994 and 1997
	respectively.</p>
<p>In the year 1997 MVSR Engineering College was shifted from the
	present campus to Nadergul village to bigger campus making MIPGS a
	separate entity in the existing campus under the same management for
	the two professional P.G. courses viz. MBA and MCA. With excellent
	track record of placements for its students, MIPGS is a renowned
	premier institution for professional P.G. course in the state of
	Andhra Pradesh.</p>
